## How Can You Help?

This project is structured in multiple milestones, and we aim to develop it incrementally. The goals and iterations are detailed below. In addition to the listed tasks, you can review the issues in the repository and start working on any of them. Your feedback, suggestions, and bug reports are invaluable to us.

### Iteration 1:

The primary goal of this iteration is to have a listing of needs, their respective locations, and an action to confirm a need. This confirmation count will be essential.
